When I began this project I took hefty inspiration from the project that we did in class.
I initially had struggled with our in class assignment, but once I had repaired my code by fixing the formatting, I had a good jumping off point for the pyramid project.
Since we only needed to make a pyramid for numbers 1 - 8 I manually formatted a print command for each option. This was done with a string of elif statements.
Although my code is not the most concise that it could possibly be, it functions as is necessary and I am happy with that.
The only struggle I faced is that I experienced repeated syntax errors, because I was missing a ")" in my first command. This eluded me for a couple of hours and I felt very silly, when I realized that such a small issue was what was holding me back from completing my assignment.
