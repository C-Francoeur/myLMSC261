## Outline for Final Project Proposal

### Description of the deliverable.
I want to make a text-based RPG, with a battle and progression system. I would also like to include basic equipment and/or stat boosters if possible. I'm planning on using python, but I would be willing to program it in a more marketable programming language if possible.

### What problem does the project solve?
This will hopefully provide a simple but fun experience for all who play it. It will also look nice on my portfolio as a bit of game design.

### What resources will you use? (specific links to others' code)
I have found a couple of videos that I find interesting, especially this one.

### What are the use cases? (who is your 'audience'?)
I want to make a game that is accessible to any and all people who are looking to play a simple video game.

### Timeline
I hope to spend the first week setting up all of my variables and to begin programming a level-up system. This will be followed up by designing the stats for my enemies, which I plan to include a handful of. Then I will design all of my attacks and finish up the battle code.

### How do you think you should be assessed?
I think I should be assessed on the functionality of the game, as fun is subjective.
