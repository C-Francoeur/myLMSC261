I personally found this project to be pretty easy!

We began by coming up with an idea, and we decided to make our band a Beatles cover band.

Johnny decided to host the project on his website, and after asking you for help, he was able to invite all of our group members and we were able to begin working on the site.

Johnny started by providing sections for each of us to edit.

I made a branch and bean working on my bio and asset. I chose to be Ringo so I wrote a cute lil description of my history with drumming. I also added in a gif that I found online by adding the file in to my branch and then referencing the file in the html document.

I was expecting to have ore trouble, but html is surprisingly easy to pick up and so I was able to implement everything that I was responsible for fairly quickly.

My other teammates seemed to be having trouble with editing their portions of the project and I attempted to help but felt like I wasn't listened to. Eventually you came and provided help to my teammates and I hope they are able to add to the website.

Patrick, although experiencing trouble, has been very talkative and engaged. Johnny also was very talkative and helpful when it comes to sharing ideas. Ran was quite quiet and hardly spoke or added anything to the project.
