## What Is Code
- Code is essentially the language of computers.

- Computers are clocks that are constantly ticking and reading data

- Your computer is constantly monitoring your keyboard, watching for each and every keystroke.
- Even when you are not pressing keys, you're computer is still processing commands, just like when you type.

- Coding is a very exact science, if you are missing so much as one quotation mark or have one word misspelled in a program, it may not function properly.

- Compilers make coding simpler by cutting simple commands own to as short as one letter.

- Computes process their information by going from character to character, this is why they are so sensitive to coding mistakes. One misclick can have an entirely different meaning than intended.

- Companies are extremely powerful when they both sell software and hardware.

### What is an algorithm
- A program is used to classify and identify/name algorithms
- Algorithms fall more on the math spectrum than the code spectrum
- Algorithms can be reused many times by coders

### Conferences
- The abundance of tech conferences allows for programers to share ideas
- The are a few conferences that are specifically for certain programming languages

### languages
- Some languages are more accessible to the programmers, while others are easier for computers to read

- XCode is mainly for coding apps

- C is very computer readable

- Different languages can be used for different projects.

### Debugging
- Another word for programming

- Although debugging is thought to be fixing issues, fixing issues is just part of the normal process

- coding is easiest when issues are fixed as they arise
