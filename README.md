##What Is Code
- Code is essentially the language of computers.

- Computers are clocks that are constantly ticking and reading data

- Your computer is constantly monitoring your keyboard, watching for each and every keystroke.
- Even when you are not pressing keys, you're computer is still processing commands, just like when you type.

- Coding is a very exact science, if you are missing so much as one quotation mark or have one word misspelled in a program, it may not function properly.

- Compilers make coding simpler by cutting simple commands own to as short as one letter.

- Computes process their information by going from character to character, this is why they are so sensitive to coding mistakes. One misclick can have an entirely different meaning than intended.
