# Process
The first step I took to begin my project was to come up with my idea. I took stock of the different tools available in scratch and decided the type of game that I wanted to make.

Then, I made the assets at would need for my game. This included a player controlled sprite and a collectable sprite. I ended up making a pac-man inspired ghost and a plate of spaghetti and meatballs. This was followed by 5 different backgrounds and a sixth victory screen.

After the art assets were complete I moved on to my audio assets. I made two different sound effects for when the spaghetti is collected as well as sounds for when each sprite is pressed. I made an audio  clip the plays when the victory conditions have been met. I finished my audio assets when I made my backing track for the game. I created a simple musical theme and set it to repeat until the victory conditions have been met.

Once I had all of the art and music assets completed it was time to put the game together. I created a control scheme for my ghost sprite. I included snake-style keyboard controls as well as mouse controls to provide players with two options on how to play. I originally wanted to make just touching the spaghetti enough to gain a point, but had trouble programming such a feature, so I decided that pressing space could be used as the button to collect spaghetti. I decided that five plates should be required to beat the game, because I wanted to gradually increase the speed of the spaghetti as the game went on and after five levels the spaghetti started to become too fast.

I created all of my programming myself and even tried using my own custom command to experiment with Scratch's features.
After the game was fully functional I decided to add a display for both points and for a timer.

I felt that the timer created replay value and that a counter would allow players to know how close they were to the end of the game.
I attempted to have the timer value stop when the game ended to keep track of high scores, but struggled to do this. I tried have the timer value spoken to the player, but this only displays the score briefly.

Overall I had a very positive experience designing and programming my game and am proud to say that the code is entirely of my own design.
