I decided to follow a repository for an RPG game called naev.
I found it to be very interesting as it is a game that is all open source.

https://github.com/naev/naev

The thing that I found most engaging about follow the updates were the informative and sometimes funny commit messages that all of the contributors submitted alongside their work.

Sometimes these messages would say things like

            pre-commit wants to eat all the trailing whitespace, hope it doesn't

I find this to be so incredibly charming, but let me get back on track and actually talk about code.

Some of the pie es of code that I found to be the most interesting were the selection of files dedicated to processes ran when the game is launched.

On update that occurred while I was watching, was a change which seperated the launch commands into seperate folders. This change appears to be part of a greater edit to improv some of the formatting on the games loading screen. Which isn't even something that I've though about.

If my game requires a lot of time to create the world adding a loading screen in the meantime could be very important.

Another cool thing is that the repository contains a test folder which appears to be for parts of the game that are in development.

While watching the game was adding a couple checks and changing around the order of some of the code already present.

This is eye opening, because it helped me to see that sometimes he solution is working with what you already have as opposed to trying to add more and making your code more bloated.

A final piece of knowledge to take from this project is how comprehensive it's list of variables is.

By having an organized list of every single shortcut that is used repeatedly through the code. contributors are able to work much faster to write future code and can shorten code to make it even more efficient. I witness a lot of code being rewritten with shortcuts this week and it was good to see people go back and improve previous work before going forwards an writing something brand new.
