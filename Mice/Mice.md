To create this command I did a little bit of digging online to see how other people separated print command into separate lines when using python
I found an extremely useful article at https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/python/print+multiple+lines+python which helped to guide the code that wrote.
I used the format that the article laid out and filled in my own commands and words.

The second solution that I came to is completely original code I made following some of the commands provided to us in class.
I felt very smart when I was able to make a fully functional print using just the raw materials that were provided to me
