The solution that I came to is completely original code I made following some of the commands provided to us in class.
I felt very smart when I was able to make a fully functional print using just the raw materials that were provided to me.

I executed python3 and my py file as seperate commands, but after asking you for help, I was learned that I must run both commands together a singular command. And thus I prefaced the py file with the python3 command.
