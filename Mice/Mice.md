To create this command I did a little bit of digging online to see how other people separated print command into separate lines when using python
I found an extremely useful article at https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/python/print+multiple+lines+python which helped to guide the code that wrote.
I used the format that the article laid out and filled in my own commands and words.
